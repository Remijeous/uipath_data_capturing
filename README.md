Web and Desktop app Data Capturing Robot using UiPath

Robot 2: Data capturing

A common daily task of a Data Capturer's life is copy-pasting data from an excel spreadsheet into a web or desktop application.
This robot fully-automates that task. The robot copy-pastes 100 lines of customer data into their respective input fields of a
web application and desktop application. The robot even performs both the web and desktop app data capturing simultaneously.
This gets the job done in a fraction of the time that a human could with 100% accuracy.
